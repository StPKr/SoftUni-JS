        <h2>Why Flexbox?</h2>
        <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were
            features like
            floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and frustrating.
        </p>
        <p>The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any
            kind of
            convenient, flexible way:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
            <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless
                of
                how much
                width/height is available.</li>
            <li>Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different
                amount
                of content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!</p>
