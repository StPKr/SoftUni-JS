                Ease of Maintenance
            </h2>
            <p>
                Using semantic elements makes it easier for developers to read and maintain code, as the structure of
                the document is clearer and more intuitive.

                Did You Know?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;article&gt; element can be used independently of the rest of the web page content, making it
                ideal for blog posts, news articles, and more.
